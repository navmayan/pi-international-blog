# Summary

* Across all IAT tasks, both deliberate and automatic evaluation measures point to a preference of the dominant category over the non-dominant category.
* Across all tasks, the bias (preference) was much larger for the automatic than the deliberate evaluation.
* Across most of the tasks, the bias stays the same across the 12 years of data collection.
* IAT scores: The strongest bias among Israeli participants was regarding **Age** (Young > Old people) and the smallest bias was regarding **Sexuality** (Straight > Gay people).

# Tasks Overview

## The IATs

* *Race ('Black - White' IAT).* This IAT requires the ability to distinguish faces of European and African origin. 

* *Ethnicity ('Ashkenazi - Mizrahi' IAT).* This IAT requires the ability to distinguish names of Ashkenazi (Europian) and Mizrahi (African) origin of Jewish Israelis. 

* *Skin-tone ('Light Skin - Dark Skin' IAT).* This IAT requires the ability to recognize light and dark-skinned faces. It often reveals an automatic preference for light-skin relative to dark-skin.

* *Age ('Young - Old' IAT).* This IAT requires the ability to distinguish old from young faces. This test often indicates that Americans have automatic preference for young over old.

* *Sexuality ('Gay - Straight' IAT).* This IAT requires the ability to distinguish words and symbols representing gay and straight people. It often reveals an automatic preference for straight relative to gay people.

* *Weight ('Fat - Thin' IAT).* This IAT requires the ability to distinguish faces of people who are obese and people who are thin. It often reveals an automatic preference for thin people relative to fat people.

* *Nationalism (USA - Own Country IAT).* This IAT often reveals a bias favoring the own country relative to USA.

* *Gender - Science.* This IAT often reveals a relative link between liberal arts and females and between science and males.

## The Self-Reports

* *Preference (att).* Preference between the dominant and non-dominant category - Which statement best describes you? Values: 1 "I strongly prefer NON-DOMINANT CATEGORY to DOMINANT CATEGORY; 7 "I strongly prefer DOMINANT CATEGORY to NON-DOMINANT CATEGORY." 4 indicates No preference.

* *Thermometer.* Cold to warm feelings toward category. Values: 0 "very cold" 1; 10 "very warm". 
Score: difference score of DOMINANT CATEGORY - NON-DOMINANT CATEGORY.

# Results

## Age IAT

<mark>Total N = `r nrow(age)`

Participation per year (N):

```{r}

yy <- age %>% group_by(year) %>% tally() 
yyt <- as.data.frame(t(yy$n)) 
colnames(yyt) <- c("2009", "2010", "2011", "2012", '2013', "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017",  "2018",  "2019",  "2020")

yyt %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed",full_width = F, position = "left"))

```


### **Evaluation measures: Overall means and correlations**

*Note*: Higher values indicate stronger bias in favor of the dominant category (young people).

#### *IAT*

The IAT scores point to a strong bias in favor of Young people.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(age,
       x = "IAT",
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "IAT", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(age, vars = vars(IAT),testValue = 0,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

#### *Self-reported preference between the categories* 

Similar to the IAT scores, the self-reported preference scores point to a strong bias in favor of Young people.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(age,
       x = "att",
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Preference", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=4, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(age, vars = vars(att),testValue = 4,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```


#### *Self-reported feeling thermometer (difference score)* 

There is a small bias in favor of Young people (in contrast to the large bias in the previous measures). 
The difference between the current and previous self-report measure might result from the nature of each measure: while the Self-reported preference measure directly compares Young and Old people (as does the IAT), the thermometer does not compare the two categories directly. A comparative context might facilitate bias.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(age,
       x = "diff_thermo",
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Thermometer difference", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(age, vars = vars(diff_thermo),testValue = 0,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

### **Correlation between the measures**

There is a small automatic-deliberate correlation, and a strong relation between the two self-report measures.

```{r}

age %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo))

```

### **IAT block-order**

The bias in favor of Young people is a bit larger for participants whos started with the incongruent blocks.

```{r}

age1 <- age %>% drop_na(blockOrder)

pp <- ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(
  data = age1,
  x = blockOrder,
  y = IAT,
  xlab = "Block-order", # label for the x-axis variable
  ylab = "IAT", # label for the y-axis variable  
  messages = FALSE,
  notch = TRUE, # show notched box plot
  mean.plotting = TRUE, # whether mean for each group is to be displayed
  mean.ci = TRUE, # whether to display confidence interval for means
  type = "parametric", # which type of test is to be run
  effsize.type = "biased",
  k = 3, # number of decimal places for statistical results  
) + # further modification outside of ggstatsplot
  ggplot2::coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 2))
pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

### *Internal/External motivation to avoid prejudice*

Overall, participants reported a strong internal motivation, and no external motivation, to respond without prejudice.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(age,
       x = c("ims_mean","ems_mean"),
       combine = TRUE,
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "IMS/EMS", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```


Both motivations were related to participants' self-reported evaluations (thermometer): external motivation was related to *more positive* evaluation, while higher internal motivation was related to *less positive* evaluation.
Note that no participant performed both IMS/EMS and IAT and self-reported preference measures.

```{r}

ggscatter(age, x = "diff_thermo", y = "ims_mean",
          add = "reg.line",                                 # Add regression line
          conf.int = TRUE,                                  # Add confidence interval
          add.params = list(color = "blue",
                            fill = "lightgray")
          )+
  stat_cor(method = "pearson", label.x = 3, label.y = 30)  # Add correlation coefficient

ggscatter(age, x = "diff_thermo", y = "ems_mean",
          add = "reg.line",                                 # Add regression line
          conf.int = TRUE,                                  # Add confidence interval
          add.params = list(color = "blue",
                            fill = "lightgray")
          )+
  stat_cor(method = "pearson", label.x = 3, label.y = 30) 

```

### **Perceptions regarding age**

```{r}

age$age <- as.numeric(age$age)
age_mean <- mean(age$age, na.rm = T)

```

The mean age in the sample was `r round(age_mean,2)`

Participants preferred to be young (~24 y/o), felt young (~27 y/o), thought they look young (~26 y/o), and hoped to live till 90+.
They thought that people turn young adults at the age of ~18, turn adult at the age of ~30, turn middle-aged at the age of ~50, and turn old at the age of ~70.

```{r}

table1(~ ctoya + yatoa + atoma + matoo + feel + choosetobe + othersthink + hopetolive, data=age)

```

* Deliberate evaluations were (weakly) negatively related to the participants' age perceptions. That is, the more participants wanted to be old, felt old, and thought they looked old, the more they preferred Old people over Young people, and vice versa.
* Automatic evaluations were not related to age perceptions.

```{r}

age %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,feel,choosetobe,othersthink,othersthink,hopetolive))

```

### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: Male participants were more biased against old people, compared with female participants (both automatically and deliberately).
* *Age*: Evaluations were not related to the participants' age.

```{r}

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | sex, data=age)

age$age <- as.numeric(age$age)
age %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,age))

```

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest anti-old bias emerged for participants unfamiliar eith the IAT. 

```{r}

age1 <- age %>% drop_na(num.x)
age1$iat_n = factor(age1$num.x, c("0", "1", "2", "3-5", "6+"))

ggline(age1, x = "iat_n", y = "IAT", add = "mean_ci")

```

### **Evaluation measures by year**

The deliberate and automatic preference between the groups stays the same (and strong) throughout the years.


*Note*: The dashed line marks the point of no preference between the two categories (Old people and Young people).

```{r}

age1 <- age %>% drop_na(year)
age1$Year <- as.factor(age$year)

## Ethnicity IAT

<mark>Total N = `r nrow(ethnic)`

Participation per year (N):

```{r}

yy <- ethnic %>% group_by(year) %>% tally() 
yyt <- as.data.frame(t(yy$n)) 
colnames(yyt) <- c("2009", "2010", "2011", "2012", '2013', "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017",  "2018",  "2019",  "2020")

yyt %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed",full_width = F, position = "left"))

```


### **Evaluation measures: Overall means and correlations**

*Note*: Higher values indicate stronger bias in favor of the dominant category (Ashkenazi people).

#### *IAT* 

The IAT scores point to a strong bias in favor of Ashkenazi people.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(ethnic,
       x = "IAT",
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "IAT", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(ethnic, vars = vars(IAT),testValue = 0,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

#### *Self-reported preference between the categories* 

There is a moderate self-reported preference of Ashkenazi people over Mizrahi people.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(ethnic,
       x = "att",
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Preference", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=4, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(ethnic, vars = vars(att),testValue = 4,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

#### *Self-reported positivity/negativity towards category (difference score)* 

There is a small bias in favor of Ashkenazi people. As with the *Age* data, the difference between the current and previous self-report measure might result from the nature of each measure: while the Self-reported preference measure directly compares Ashkenazi and Misrahi people (as does the IAT), the current measure does not compare the two categories directly. A comparative context might facilitate bias.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(ethnic,
       x = "diff_pref",
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Attitude difference", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE

pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(ethnic, vars = vars(diff_pref),testValue = 0,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

### **Correlation between the measures** 

There is a small-moderate automatic-deliberate correlation, and a strong relation between the two self-report measures.

```{r}

ethnic %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_pref))

```

### **IAT block-order**

No block-order effect emerged.

```{r}

ethnic1 <- ethnic %>% drop_na(blockOrder)

pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```


### **Perceived preference in society**

Overall, participants thought that there is a very strong preference of Ashkenazi people over Mizrahi Israelis.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(ethnic,
       x = "isr",
       combine = TRUE,
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Perceived preference", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE

pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(ethnic, vars = vars(isr),testValue = 4,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```


### **Perceptions regarding ethnicity**

The proportion of ethnicities in the sample was:

```{r}

#table(ethnic$ethnic.c)
ethnic$ethnicity <- NA
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='5+ Zabar'] <- "Zabar"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='Arab countries'] <- "Mizrahi"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='North Africa'] <- "Mizrahi"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='East Europe'] <- "Ashkenazi"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='West Europe'] <- "Ashkenazi"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='Russia'] <- "Ashkenazi"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='Mixed Miz/Ash'] <- "Mixed Miz/Ash"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='East Asia'] <- "Other"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='Ethiopia'] <- "Other"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='Mixed (other)'] <- "Other"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='North America'] <- "Other"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='Other'] <- "Other"
ethnic$ethnicity[ethnic$ethnic.c=='South American'] <- "Other"

ee <- ethnic %>% group_by(ethnicity) %>% tally() 
eet <- as.data.frame(t(ee$n)) 
colnames(eet) <- c("Ashkenazi", "Mixed Miz/Ash", "Mizrahi", "Other", 'Zabar')

eet %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed",full_width = F, position = "left"))


```

```{r recode ethnicity perceptions}

ethnic$hot_rs <- dplyr::recode(ethnic$hot, `-3` = 3, `-2` = 2, `-1` = 1, `0` = 0, `1` = -1, `2` = -2, `3` = -3)
ethnic$nice_rs <- dplyr::recode(ethnic$nice, `-3` = 3, `-2` = 2, `-1` = 1, `0` = 0, `1` = -1, `2` = -2, `3` = -3)

```

Overall, participants thought that neither category is scarier than the other (though a larger part of the distribution thought Mizrahi Israelis are scarier). Ashkenazi Israelis were considered as more sexually attractive, Misrahi Israelis as smarter, and Ashkenazi Israelis as nicer.


*Note*: The dashed lines mark the mean (black) and the point of no difference (0, blue).

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(ethnic,
       x = c("scare","hot_rs","smart","nice_rs"),
       combine = T,
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Perceptions", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)
pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

Looking at the perceptions *per ethnicity*, we get a somewhat different picture:
- A larger part of the distribution of Ashkenazi and Mixed-ethnicity participants thought that Mizrahi Israelis are scarier, compared with Mizrahi, Zabar, and Other participants.
- The pro-Mizrahi bias in Smart was smaller for Ashkenazi and Zabar participants.
- Both Mizrahi and Zabar participants did not think Ashkenazi Israelis are nicer.

There was a positive relation between all evaluation measures and all perception measures, but Smart and Scare were most strongly related to evaluation.

```{r}

ethnic %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_pref,scare,hot_rs,smart,nice_rs))

```

### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: Male participants were more biased against Misrahi Israelis, compared with female participants (both automatically and deliberately).
* *Ethnicity among Jews*: Automatically, Zabar Israelis and Europian Israelis were most biased against Misrahi Israelis, and Ethiopian Isaraelis, North Africa, and Arab-countries Israelis were least biased. This pattern also emerged in one of the two self-report measures (preference), while the other measure (attitude difference) showed that Arab-countries, Asian, Ethiopian, North African, and Other Israelis are biased against the dominant group - Ashkenazi Israelis.
* *Ethnicity among Israelis in general*: Automatically, Arab Israelis were least biased, with no substantial difference among the other groups. Arabs were also least biased deliberately.  
* *Religion groups*: The sample-size for the individual groups is rather small, so it's difficult to make strong claims here.
Muslims were least biased, both automatically and deliberately. Christians were most biased.
* The evaluations were (negatively) correlated with the participants' religiosity, but not with their age.
  + Misrahi and Zabar Israelis were most religious.

```{r}

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_pref | sex, data=ethnic)

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_pref | ethnic.c, data=ethnic)

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_pref | ethnicityomb, data=ethnic)

ethnic$age <- as.numeric(ethnic$age)
ethnic %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_pref,age,religionid))

table1(~ religionid | ethnicity, data=ethnic)

```

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest anti-Misrahi bias emerged for participants unfamiliar with the IAT. 

```{r}

ethnic1 <- ethnic %>% drop_na(num.x)
ethnic1$iat_n = factor(ethnic1$num.x, c("0", "1", "2", "3-5", "6+"))

ggline(ethnic1, x = "iat_n", y = "IAT", add = "mean_ci")

```

### **Evaluation measures by year**

The deliberate preference between the groups is reduced throughout the years (i.e., less bias), but the automatic bias stays pretty much the same.


*Note*: The dashed line marks the point of no preference between the two categories (Misrahi Israelis and Ashkenazi Israelis).

```{r}

### **Correlation between the measures** 

There is a small automatic-deliberate correlation, and a strong relation between the two self-report measures.

```{r}

race %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo))

```

### **IAT block-order**

The bias is larger for participants who started with the incongruent block.

### **Right wing authoritarianism**

There is a high level of RWA.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

### **social dominance orientation**

There is no SDO


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(race, vars = vars(sdo_mean),testValue = 3.5,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

* *Correlation between the measures*:

Evaluation measures are positively related to SDO, but not to RWA.

```{r}

race %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,sdo_mean,rwa_mean))

```

### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: Male participants were more biased against Black people, compared with female participants (both automatically and deliberately).
* *Ethnicity among Jews*: Automatically, Russian Israelis were most biased against Black people, and Ethiopian Isaraelis were least biased. This pattern also emerged in one of the two self-report measures (thermometer), while the other measure (preference) showed the least bias among Ethiopians, and no substantial difference among the other categories.
* *Ethnicity among Israelis in general*: Automatically, Arab Israelis were least biased, with no substantial difference among the other groups. Arabs annd Other were least biased deliberately.  

```{r}

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | sex, data=race)

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | ethnic.c, data=race)

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | ethnicityomb, data=race)

race$age <- as.numeric(race$age)
race %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,age,religionid))

#table1(~ religionid | ethnicity, data=race)

```

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest anti-Black bias emerged for participants unfamiliar with the IAT. 

```{r}

race1 <- race %>% drop_na(num.x)
race1$iat_n = factor(race1$num.x, c("0", "1", "2", "3-5", "6+"))

ggline(race1, x = "iat_n", y = "IAT", add = "mean_ci")

```

### **Evaluation measures by year**

Both deliberate and automatic bias stays pretty much the same throughout the years, with a strong anti-Black automatic bias, also appearing in the direct preference measure.
*Note*: The dashed line marks the point of no preference between the two categories (Black people and White people).

```{r}

race1 <- race %>% drop_na(year)

### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: Male participants were more biased against Dark-skinned people, compared with female participants (both automatically and deliberately).
* *Ethnicity among Jews*: Automatically, East-Europe and South-American Israelis were most biased against Dark-skinned people, and Ethiopian Isaraelis were least biased. This pattern also emerged deliberately, showing the least bias among Ethiopians, most bias among West-Europe, South-American, and Arab-countries Israelis.
* *Ethnicity among Israelis in general*: Druze and Jews were most biased, both deliberately and automatically.  

```{r}

table1(~ IAT + diff_thermo | sex, data=skin)

table1(~ IAT + diff_thermo | ethnic.c, data=skin)

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest anti-Black bias emerged for participants unfamiliar eith the IAT. 

```{r}

ggline(skin1, x = "iat_n", y = "IAT", add = "mean_ci")

```

### **Evaluation measures by year**

Both deliberate and automatic bias stays pretty much the same throughout the years, with a strong anti-Dark-skinned automatic bias, also appearing in the thermometer measure.

*Note*: The dashed line marks the point of no preference between the two categories (Dark-skinned people and Light-skinned people).

#### *Self-reported feeling thermometer (difference score)* 

There is a strong bias in favor of thin people.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(weight,
       x = "diff_thermo",

       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Thermometer difference",

pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(weight, vars = vars("diff_thermo"),testValue = 0,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```


### **Correlation between the measures** 

There is a small automatic-deliberate correlation, and a strong relation between the three self-report measures.

```{r}

weight %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo))

```

### **IAT block-order**

The bias is larger for participants who started with the incongruent block.

```{r}

weight1 <- weight %>% drop_na(blockOrder)

pp <- ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(
  data = weight1,
  x = blockOrder,
  y = IAT,
  xlab = "Block-order", # label for the x-axis variable
  ylab = "IAT", # label for the y-axis variable  
  messages = FALSE,
  notch = TRUE, # show notched box plot
  mean.plotting = TRUE, # whether mean for each group is to be displayed
  mean.ci = TRUE, # whether to display confidence interval for means
  type = "parametric", # which type of test is to be run
  effsize.type = "biased",
  k = 3, # number of decimal places for statistical results  
) + # further modification outside of ggstatsplot
  ggplot2::coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 2))
pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

### **Internal/External motivation to avoid prejudice**

Overall, participants reported a strong internal motivation, and also external motivation, to respond without prejudice.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(weight,
       x = c("ims_mean","ems_mean"),
       combine = TRUE,
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "IMS/EMS", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

Higher internal motivation was related to *less positive* feelings toward *fat people*.
Note that no participant performed both IMS/EMS and the self-reported preference measure.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

weight %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo, ims_mean, ems_mean))

ggscatter(weight, x = "diff_thermo", y = "ims_mean",
          add = "reg.line",                                 # Add regression line
          conf.int = TRUE,                                  # Add confidence interval
          add.params = list(color = "blue",
                            fill = "lightgray")
          )+
  stat_cor(method = "pearson", label.x = 3, label.y = 30)  # Add correlation coefficient

```


### **Perceptions regarding weight**

```{r}

weight$weightkg <- as.numeric(weight$weightkg)

weight1 <- weight %>% filter(weightkg > 30) %>% filter(weightkg < 300)

pp <- ggdensity(weight1,
       x = "weightkg",
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "Participants' weight Kg", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

weight_mean <- mean(weight1$weightkg, na.rm = T)

```

The mean weight in the sample was `r round(weight_mean,2)` (excluding values below 30 and above 300).

Participants tought that it is somewhat difficult to lose weight, that people have some control over their weight, that there is a slight bias against fat people, and that they are neither underweight nor overweight.

```{r}

table1(~ easytolose + important + controlother + controlyou + othersay + mostpref + comptomost + iam, data=weight)

```

* Deliberate evaluations were (weakly) related to participants' perceived importance of their weight, while automatic evaluations were mostly (weakly) reslated to the participants' perceived weight status (whether they are thin or fat), and to what they think other people would say about them.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

weight %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,easytolose, important, controlother , controlyou, othersay, mostpref, comptomost, iam))

```

### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: Male participants were more biased against fat people, compared with female participants (both automatically and deliberately).
* The evaluations were not correlated with the participants' weight.

```{r}

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | sex, data=weight)

weight$weightkg <- as.numeric(weight$weightkg)
weight %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,weightkg))

```

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest anti-fat bias emerged for participants unfamiliar eith the IAT. 

```{r}

weight1 <- weight %>% drop_na(num.x)
weight1$iat_n = factor(weight1$num.x, c("0", "1", "2", "3-5", "6+"))

ggline(weight1, x = "iat_n", y = "IAT", add = "mean_ci")

```

### **Evaluation measures by year**

The deliberate and automatic preference between the groups stays the same (and strong) throughout the years.

*Note*: The dashed line marks the point of no preference between the two categories (Fat people and Thin people).

```{r}

weight1 <- weight %>% drop_na(year)
weight1$Year <- as.factor(weight1$year)

```


### **Evaluation measures: Overall means and correlations**

*Note*: Higher values indicate stronger bias in favor of the dominant category (straight people).

#### *IAT* 

The IAT scores point to a strong bias in favor of straight people.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(sexuality, vars = vars("att"),testValue = 4,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

#### *Self-reported feeling thermometer: straight/gay males (difference score)* 

There is a small-moderate bias in favor of straight males; the bias is much larger toward females.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(sexuality,

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(sexuality, vars = vars("diff_thermo_male"),testValue = 0,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

#### *Self-reported feeling thermometer: straight/gay females (difference score)* 

There is a medium bias in favor of straight females.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

pp <- ggdensity(sexuality,
       x = "diff_thermo_female",
       y = "..density..",

pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(sexuality, vars = vars("diff_thermo_female"),testValue = 0,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

### **Correlation between the measures** 

There is a medium automatic-deliberate correlation, and a strong relation between the three self-report measures.

```{r}

sexuality %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo_female, diff_thermo_male))

```

### **IAT block-order**

The bias is larger for participants that started with the incongruent block.

```{r}

```

### **Perceptions regarding sexuality**

Most participants in the sample were straight (57%).
Most participants were inclined to grant equal rights to gay people. 

```{r}

table1(~ factor(relationslegal) + factor(marriagerights) + factor(sexuality) , data=sexuality) 

```

### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: Male participants were more biased against gay people, compared with female participants (both automatically and deliberately).
* *Ethnicity among Jews*: East-Asian Israelis were most biased against gay people, both automatically and deliberately, with no substantial difference between the other groups. 
* *Ethnicity among Israelis in general*: Arabs and Druze were most biased against gay people, both automatically and deliberately.  
* All evaluations were positively related to religiousity.

```{r}

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest anti-gay bias emerged for participants unfamiliar with the IAT. 

```{r}

### **Evaluation measures: Overall means and correlations**

*Note*: Higher values indicate stronger bias in favor of the dominant category (Males + Science).

#### *IAT* 

The IAT scores point to a strong bias in favor of Males + Science (and Females + Liberal arts).


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```

### **Correlation between the measures** 

There is a small automatic-deliberate correlation, and a strong relation between two of the three self-report measures.

```{r}

gender_science %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,diff_attitudes, diff_lsciarts, diff_learned))

```

### **IAT block-order**

The bias was larger for participants that started with the congruent block.

```{r}

gender_science1 <- gender_science %>% drop_na(blockOrder)

pp <- ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(
  data = gender_science1,
  x = blockOrder,
  y = IAT,
  xlab = "Block-order", # label for the x-axis variable

  effsize.type = "biased",
  k = 3, # number of decimal places for statistical results

pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")

```

### **Perceptions regarding gender and science**

* *Explaining unequal occupations for men & women*

Participants tought that unequal encouragement and bias in hiring & promotion are the main reasons for unequal occupations for men & women. 
Women assigned more importance the family, disencouragement, and discrimination factors, than men did.

```{r}

table1(~ factorhighpower + factorfamily + factorability + factorinterest + factorencouragement + factordiscrimination, data=gender_science) 
table1(~ factorhighpower + factorfamily + factorability + factorinterest + factorencouragement + factordiscrimination | sex , data=gender_science)

```

* *Goals importance*

Participants' most important goal was to gain knowledge in science.
Women were more interested in gaining knowledge in arts, while men were more interested in gaining knowledge in math and science.

```{r}

table1(~ goal1 + goal2 + goal3, data=gender_science) 
table1(~ goal1 + goal2 + goal3 | sex , data=gender_science)

```


### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: Both females and males had a strong automatic bias of linking science to males and arts to females. 
Deliberately, female participants preferred arts than science, and linked science to males and arts to females. Male participants liked science and arts to the same degree, and also linked science to males and arts to females.
* *Ethnicity among Israelis in general*: Jews were the most biased in favor of science+male automatically, while deliberately, they showed the strongest preference toward the opposite direction.  

```{r}

table1(~ IAT + science + arts + diff_attitudes + Lscience + Larts + diff_lsciarts + likesci + likeart + diff_learned | sex, data=gender_science)

table1(~ IAT + science + arts + diff_attitudes + Lscience + Larts + diff_lsciarts + likesci + likeart + diff_learned | ethnicityomb, data=gender_science)

```

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest male+science bias emerged for participants unfamiliar with the IAT (and those who completed once IAT before). 

```{r}

gender_science1 <- gender_science %>% drop_na(num.x)
gender_science1$iat_n = factor(gender_science1$num.x, c("0", "1", "2", "3-5", "6+"))

ggline(gender_science1, x = "iat_n", y = "IAT", add = "mean_ci")

```

### **Evaluation measures by year**

The deliberate and automatic stereotype (science+male, arts+female) stays the same (and strong) throughout the years. The preference between science and arts also stays the same, but here participants show a lack of bias (or a tiny bias in favor of arts).
*Note*: The dashed line marks the point of no preference between the two categories.

### **Right wing authoritarianism**

There is a high level of RWA.


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

usa$rwa_mean <- as.numeric(usa$rwa_mean)

pp <- ggdensity(usa,
       x = "rwa_mean",
       combine = TRUE,

       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(usa, vars = vars("rwa_mean"),testValue = 3.5,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

### **social dominance orientation**

There is no SDO


*Note*: The black dashed line marks the mean, and the blue dashed line marks the point of no preference.

```{r}

usa$sdo_mean <- as.numeric(usa$sdo_mean)

pp <- ggdensity(usa,
       x = "sdo_mean",
       combine = TRUE,
       y = "..density..",
       fill = "lightblue",
       xlab = "SDO", 
       add = "mean",
       size = 1, 
       rug = TRUE
)

pp <- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=3.5, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "darkblue", size=1.2)

pp <- pp + font("title", size = 20, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("legend.text", size = 16, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xlab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("ylab", size = 18, color = "black", face = "bold")+
font("xy.text", size = 15, color = "black", face = "bold")
pp <- pp +theme(legend.position="none")
pp

```

```{r}

ttestOneS(usa, vars = vars("sdo_mean"),testValue = 3.5,effectSize=T,ci=T)

```

* *Correlation between the measures*:

There were no substantial correlations between the measures.

```{r}

usa %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,sdo_mean,rwa_mean))

```


### **Evaluation measures by demographics**

* *Sex*: There weren't any differences between males and females.
* *Ethnicity among Jews*: There weren't any differences between the groups. 
* *Ethnicity among Israelis in general*: The sample-size for the individual groups is rather small, so it's difficult to make strong claims here.  
* *Religion groups*: The sample-size for the individual groups is rather small, so it's difficult to make strong claims here.
* All the evaluation measures were positively related to religiousity.  

```{r}

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | sex, data=usa)

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | ethnic.c, data=usa)

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | ethnicityomb, data=usa)

table1(~ IAT + att + diff_thermo | religion, data=usa)

usa$age <- as.numeric(usa$age)
usa %>% corrMatrix(vars = vars(IAT,att,diff_thermo,age,religionid))

```

### **IAT by N of previous IATs**

The strongest pro-Israel bias emerged for participants unfamiliar with the IAT. 

```{r}

usa1 <- usa %>% drop_na(num.x)
usa1$iat_n = factor(usa1$num.x, c("0", "1", "2", "3-5", "6+"))

ggline(usa1, x = "iat_n", y = "IAT", add = "mean_ci")

```

### **Evaluation measures by year**

The deliberate and automatic preference between the groups stays the same (and strong) throughout the years.

*Note*: The dashed line marks the point of no preference between the two categories (Israel and USA).

```{r}

usa1 <- usa %>% drop_na(year)
usa1$Year <- as.factor(usa1$year)

p1 <- ggviolin(usa1, x = "Year",
      y = c("IAT"),

# Compare all IATs

```{r}

age <- age %>% select(session_id,IAT) %>% mutate(Task = "Age")
ethnic <- ethnic %>% select(session_id,IAT) %>% mutate(Task = "Ethnicity")
race <- race %>% select(session_id,IAT) %>% mutate(Task = "Race")
skin <- skin %>% select(session_id,IAT) %>% mutate(Task = "Skin")
weight <- weight %>% select(session_id,IAT) %>% mutate(Task = "Weight")
sexuality <- sexuality %>% select(session_id,IAT) %>% mutate(Task = "Sexuality")

usa <- usa %>% select(session_id,IAT) %>% mutate(Task = "Nationalism")

combined_df <- bind_rows(age,ethnic,race,skin,weight,sexuality,gender_science,usa)

```

The strongest bias among Israeli participants is regarding Age (Young > Old people) and the smallest bias is regarding Sexuality (Straight > Gay people).
