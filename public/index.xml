      <description>This is the blog of Project Implicit&amp;rsquo;s international demonstration websites. Beyond the U.S demostration website, Project Implicit collects data from 40 different countries across the world. We will use this blog to post the results from 10 years of study (2009-2019), for various countries and IAT test topics such as race, age, and nationalism.
All data could be found on the OSF repository of the international sites INSERT LINK HERE.</description>
