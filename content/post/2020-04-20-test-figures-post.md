Participation per year (N):

#### **Evaluation measures**

*Note*: Higher values indicate stronger bias in favor of the dominant
category (young people).

-   *IAT*: There is a strong bias in favor of Young people

-   *Self-reported preference between the categories*: There is a strong
    bias in favor of Young people

-   *Self-reported feeling thermometer (difference score)*: There is a
    small bias in favor of Young people. The difference between the
    current and previous measure might result from the nature of each
    measure: while the Self-reported preference measure directly
    compares Young and Old people (as does the IAT), the thermometer
    does not compare the two categories directly. A comparative context
    might facilitate bias.

-   *Correlation between the measures*: There is a small
    automatic-deliberate correlation, and a strong relation between the
    two self-report measures.

#### **Evaluation measures by year**

The deliberate and automatic preference between the groups stays the
same (and strong) throughout the years. *Note*: The dashed line marks
the point of no preference between the two categories (Old people and
Young people).
